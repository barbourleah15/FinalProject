            <p>Have you ever had a near miss with another car at the 95/64 exchange? Or what about a bicyclist who darts out from a side street in Carytown? Weâ€™ve all had close calls, or possibly even an accident, here on the Richmond roads, but where are we most likely to encounter such a scenario? And should we expect to see more or fewer accidents in the future?</p>

            <p>Using API calls to gather data, we plotted elements that would allow the user to see which areas have increased incidents, road construction, as well as areas of bicycle versus vehicle accidents. </p>

            <p>Machine learning was utilized to investigate if the Richmond area housing market was increasing or decreasing in size to assess if we expect to see more incidents or not. With more people in the metropolitan area we would likely find that there will be more congestion, more required construction to maintain heavily utilized roads, and more accidents between cars and bicyclists. In reviewing the data we found that there was a high level of seasonality that needed to be accounted for and therefore SARIMA was used to forecast future growth in the housing market, which appears to be tightening up.</p>

            <p>But what are some of the possible causes behind bicycle involved crashes? After scrubbing some data and using the KNN test, we defined road conditions and used machine learning to analyze poor road conditions and then used predictive analysis to see if there was a strong correlation between bike accidents and road conditions. In reviewing 100 values for the KNN test we found that there was indeed a strong correlation between poor road conditions and bicycle involved accidents.</p>

            <p>Overall, we found that poor road conditions, popular downtown streets, and road construction projects contributed to the highest rates of accidents, especially in regards to bicyclists. Surprisingly, a visual inspection of those involving a bicyclist were noted to show a high rate of accidents at intersections. However, with the greater Richmond housing market forecasted to decrease, road construction improvements, driver awareness, and more bicycle lanes, we hope to see these numbers decrease. </p>
